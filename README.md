# Job Posting Tracker - Bangladesh

As of **February 17, 2025**, the table below illustrates that companies in Bangladesh generally do not post job openings in a centralized location. 

### Objective:
To develop an automated bot that:
- Monitors company websites for new job postings.
- Sends alerts when a new job is posted.
- Maintains a centralized job tracking system.

This solution will:
1. Ensure timely notifications for job seekers.
2. Provide an organized list of companies hiring across multiple platforms.
